// MODULES are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, 
// the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.
//
// STATE rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when 
// in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? 
// They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are 
// smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in 
// different views like the home page or the inside page.
//
// ** Naming Convention
// Module rules should start with the name of the module.
// Related elements within a module shold use the base name as the prefix.
//
// ** Basic guidelines
// - When defining the rule set for a module, avoid using IDs and element 
//   selectors, sticking only to class names. 
// - Only include a selector that includes semantics.
// - Modules sit inside Layout components. 
// - Modules can sometimes sit within other Modules, too. 
// - Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone component so it can 
// easily be moved to different parts of the layout without breaking.

// REMEMBER that these are guidelines not hard rules to never be broken
